# AutonomousCar
The overall plan is to create a car that can follow a black electrical tape line after navigating via aWi-Fi connection. 
The creation of the car is broken into nine projects.

The first project is the installation of the Control Board to the FRAM Experimenters Board andthe addition of the battery power system for independent operation. A power switch is providedto minimize battery drain.

The second project is the installation of the LCD onto the control board. Demo your workingLCD with the Hardware Test code.

The third project is the creation of the car with the forward only part of the H-bridge control forthe wheels. Successful verification will be of the car moving in predetermined shapes within a36” x 36” square area.

The fourth project is adding full control of the H-Bridge allowing the vehicle to travel forwardand reverse. Verification will be with timed travel forward followed by timed travel in reverse.

The fifth project is the addition of the emitter / detector circuit that will detect the black line.

The sixth project will be replacing the timed travel forward and reverse from project 4 withintercepting and navigating around a black line circle.

The seventh project is the serial communication. There will be homework assignments that willassist in building software routines that can be used in the project.

The eighth project is to communicate with a Wi-Fi device.

The ninth project is steering via a web interface, auto intercepting and following a black lineto the course end.The Wi-Fi course will be to navigate an area in the quad or EBII Hallway. Navigation of each Wi-Fi course segment will be considered successful by driving into the 1-footsquare and stopping; if it is the last point, or passing over on the way to the next point.
